📌 Exploratory Data Analysis – Paisabazaar Banking Fraud & Credit Behaviour Analysis

This project focuses on understanding customer credit behaviour using real financial data from Paisabazaar.
The goal is to explore how customers manage their loans, credit cards, payments, and debt, and identify the patterns that influence their credit score, financial risk, and potential fraud activity.

🚀 Project Objectives

Analyze customer-level financial behaviour

Identify high-impact factors affecting credit score

Detect risky patterns such as high utilization, multiple inquiries, delayed payments, and heavy debt

Support better credit decision-making for financial institutions

Provide insights useful for fraud detection and risk monitoring
